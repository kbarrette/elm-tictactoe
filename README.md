# elm-tictactoe

An exercise in learning Elm

Goals:
1. Be simple - for example, the human player is always X and goes first
2. Use only Elm standard library - gluing together a bunch of existing libraries means less opportunity to learn Elm
3. Be idiomatic

## Building

```bash
elm-make src/Main.elm --warn
```
